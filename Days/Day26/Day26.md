#Day26/100


Taking Forward My TwitterMaster Project. Today I build Post Writing Funcanality and add some more frontend functions in-app. So, Till this point, I am able to complete all the basic pages of ap. like home page, login page, Explore, tweet, etc. And My next target will be to design the database first then start to build the backend of my project. because most of the basic frontend things are done.



Thank You For Reading.
