#Day54/100





Implement Tweet Add Functionality in React app of TwitterMaster(clone of Twitter) Project. Last time I create the API for upload files and videos with tweets and today I connect the API with the client-side. And Also learn the basics of redux as now the app becomes more complex so I want to manage the state of the app in a nicer way.





Thank You For Reading.
