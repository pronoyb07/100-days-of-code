Today I Finished the Manual Auth with JWT to create user token and bcrypt.js for Hash the password. you can see in the video the new token create when the user sign up or sign in into app.js



Also, I am learning docker. I am learning from Docker docs. so, today I install one node to-do project and learn what is Dockerfile, basic commands which we can use in a file, and how to build an image and run the image.
