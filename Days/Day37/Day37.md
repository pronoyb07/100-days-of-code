#Day37/100

As part of building the game in Typescript. Today I was able to finish most of the game. like hero, enemies, shoot the bullet, etc. You can find the game link and also the code link. Know, My next step will be to build some backend for the game so that it can be a multiple-person game (like two-player play at a time). Play the game if you want and tell me the bugs ðŸŽ…, so that I can work on it.
