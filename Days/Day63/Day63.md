#Day63/100

Hello Folks,



I am happy to share that I am able to  Complete My tweeterMaster Project. A fully Function Social Media App. it take me around 1 month to complete the project. In the end, I learn about node js, React js, Redux, MongoDB, material UI, etc.



Link: https://twittermaster.netlify.app/



App Main functionality:

1. User Login/SingUp

2. Tweet Cration And Deletion

3. User can follow other User

4. Users can Comment, Like and Share the tweet

5. Users can Crate a group and then create tweets related to that group

6. Tweet, User, And Group Search 





For me, it's a great achievement because this is my first full-stack project where I build the frontend, backend, and also crate the database. Also, I learn how to host The App on the Web.



So, this is Version 1.0 of My App. As I know what is Socket Programming I am going to add chat functionality to the app.



If you like my work then please like this post so that I get motivation and I can build such amazing things.



Thank you for reading
