#Day20/100


Today, I Make My First Pull Request for an Open source project. I make a pull request on PrismJS/prism-themes Repository. I create one theme and make the pull request. The first time the member of the repository said I have to change some of the things. so, then I change Some of the things, run the test, and asks him to check again. and I am sure after some time it will marge.



Special Thanks to @Kunal Kushwaha for giving such great guidance to us on his youtube channel. His videos are one which makes my interest in Open source and I will try my best to Contribute to Open-source.
